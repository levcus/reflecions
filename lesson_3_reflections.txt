When would you want to create a remote reposiroty rather than keeping all your
work local?

Mostly when we will work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Bacause an automatic update can create conflicts with the local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

FORKS:
It is a copy of a GitHub repository in a GitHub account. We fork a repository
when we do not have permission to modify a repository.

CLONES:
It is a copy of a repository in a local machine. We can make a clone from a 
GitHub account to a local machine or inside of a local machine. We make a clone
when we want to start to work in a repository.

BRANCHES:
It is a division of a commit history. We create a branch when we want to work 
in a new feature or try something that may not be fully functional without 
interfering or modifying that particular commit history.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

That allows to detect and to reduce the number of conflicts in the project.
