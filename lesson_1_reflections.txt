How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped in the way that I can focus in the differences of both files instead
of the entire files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

It makes debugging easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
Google Docs does?

Pros:

• With practice we can have a proper number of commits that will make the 
process of debugging more efficient.

Cons:

• If the programmer forgets to create commits the process of debugging will be 
in extreme difficult.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file 
separately?

Because in some cases the files are related. Some changes in a file may force 
to change the content in others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With "git log" we get the list of commits and with "git diff" we can compare 
commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

Version control gives us a lot of confidence because always we can go back 
before the problems started.
