How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A logical change can involve changes in multiple files. The staging area allows to 
put all modified files in one place prior to commit them.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

Trying new features. Something experimental. This give peace of mind because you are 
not modifiyng the main project.
